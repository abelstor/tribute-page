            Their malaria vaccine, SPf66, developed in 1987, significantly reduced the disease in

        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo's life:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1946</strong> - Born on November 3rd in Ataco, Tolima, Colombia.</li>
            <li><strong>1965-1970</strong> - Studies medicine and surgery at the National University of Colombia in
                Bogotá, graduating with honors.</li>
            <li><strong>1972-1974</strong> - Conducts postdoctoral research in immunology and virology at Yale
                University in the United States.</li>
            <li><strong>Early 1980s</strong> - Establishes the Institute of Immunology at the San Juan de Dios Hospital
                in Bogotá, laying the groundwork for his malaria vaccine research.</li>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> - After years of research with his team in Colombia, announces the first synthetic
                vaccine against <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria, known as SPf66.</li>
            <li><strong>1987-1988</strong> - Conducts initial field trials of the SPf66 vaccine in the Colombian Amazon
                region, working with indigenous communities.</li>
            <li><strong>1990s</strong> - Large-scale trials of the SPf66 vaccine are carried out in various countries in
                Latin America (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil) and Africa (Tanzania, The Gambia, Thailand).
                Results show variable efficacy.</li>
            <li><strong>1994</strong> - In a controversial and celebrated move, donates the patent for the SPf66 malaria
                vaccine to the World Health Organization (WHO).</li>
            <li><strong>1995</strong> - Awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research in
                recognition of his work.</li>
            <li><strong>Late 1990s - 2000s</strong> - Relocates part of his research operations to the Amazon region,
                establishing the Amazon Institute of Immunology Foundation (FIDIC) on the banks of the Loretoyacu River.
                He continues working on a new generation of synthetic vaccines based on the "Molecular Logic" principle.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong> - Publishes research in the journal <em>Chemical Reviews</em> outlining a new
                methodology for vaccine development based on logical rules for protein synthesis (the "Molecular Logic"
                principle), aiming to create highly effective and inexpensive synthetic vaccines.</li>
            <li><strong>2012-2020</strong> - Continues his research in the Amazon, focusing on applying his
                principles to develop vaccines for other diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, and others. His work
                remains a subject of both international interest and scientific debate.</li>
            <li><strong>2025</strong> - dies at the age of 78.</li>
